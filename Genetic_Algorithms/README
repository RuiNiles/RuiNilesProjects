These are my genetic algorithms for the black box and knapsack problems.

To inspect the code open the example.java file in this directory. 
Solution01 addresses the black box problem while Solution02 addresses the knapsack problem.

To run the demo for the code download all .class and .java files and in a command line compile them and run example.java

Thank You.
